## Instructions

1. **Field Salad**: Field salad, also known as lamb's lettuce, m√¢che, corn salad, or lamb's tongue, should be thoroughly cleaned and washed. Place it in a bowl.

2. **Prepare Dressing**: Finely dice the onion. Set aside a tablespoon of diced onions. Mix the remaining onions with salt, salad herbs, honey, vinegar, and oil to prepare the salad dressing. Adjust seasoning to taste.

3. **Prepare Croutons**: Heat a pan and let olive oil heat up. Roast the bacon cubes with the remaining onions until crispy. Place them on a paper towel to absorb excess fat. Cut the baguette or white bread, preferably 2 - 3 days old, into small cubes. Fry them in hot olive oil, stirring constantly, until browned on all sides.

4. **Prepare Croutons Part 2**: Place the fried bread cubes on a paper towel to absorb excess fat.

5. **Assemble Salad**: Toss the field salad in the bowl with the prepared salad dressing and divide into portions. Arrange the bacon and croutons on top of each salad portion, starting with the bacon and then the croutons.

6. **Serve**: Not only does it look delicious, but it also tastes delicious. Enjoy your salad!
