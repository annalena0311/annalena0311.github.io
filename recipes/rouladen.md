## Instructions

1. **Prepare Rouladen**:
   - Saut√© the diced onion and bacon in some butter in a pan over medium heat until soft but not browned. Remove from heat and let cool.
   - Season the roulades with salt and pepper on both sides. Spread each roulade with mustard, then evenly distribute the onion/bacon mixture and the finely diced cornichons over each roulade, leaving a small border around the edges. Roll up each roulade tightly lengthwise, folding in the sides as you roll to prevent filling from spilling out. Secure each roulade with kitchen twine or toothpicks.

2. **Brown Rouladen**:
   - In a large ovenproof skillet or roasting pan, heat some butter or lard over medium-high heat. Brown the roulades on all sides until golden brown, about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove the roulades from the pan and set aside.
   - In the same pan, add the chopped soup greens and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until browned. Add the tomato paste and cook for another minute, allowing it to caramelize slightly.
   - Deglaze the pan with red wine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Let the wine reduce slightly, then return the roulades to the pan. Pour in the beef broth, cover with a lid, and transfer to a preheated oven set to 180¬∞C (350¬∞F). Braise the roulades for about 1.5 hours, or until they are tender and cooked through.

3. **Prepare Red Cabbage**:
   - Remove the outer leaves of the red cabbage, then halve and core it. Finely shred the cabbage or cut it into thin strips.
   - In a large pot or Dutch oven, melt the lard or butter over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the diced apple and cook for another 2-3 minutes.
   - Stir in the shredded red cabbage, sugar, apple jelly, red wine, vegetable broth, cloves, star anise, cinnamon stick, allspice, and bay leaves. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
   - Bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Let the red cabbage simmer gently for 1-1.5 hours, stirring occasionally, until it is tender. Adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, and balsamic vinegar if desired.

4. **Make Sp√§tzle**:
   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, eggs, nutmeg, salt, and water. Stir until a smooth batter forms. Let the batter rest for 10 minutes.
   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Working in batches, press the sp√§tzle dough through a sp√§tzle maker or a colander with large holes directly into the boiling water. Cook the sp√§tzle for 2-3 minutes, or until they float to the surface.
   - Using a slotted spoon, transfer the cooked sp√§tzle to a colander and drain. Repeat the process with the remaining dough.

5. **Serve**:
   - Remove the roulades from the oven and transfer them to a serving platter. Remove the kitchen twine or toothpicks from the roulades, if used. Strain the sauce from the pan through a fine-mesh sieve into a sauceboat or gravy boat.
   - Serve the roulades hot with the red cabbage and sp√§tzle on the side. Drizzle the roulades with the sauce and enjoy!
